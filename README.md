Background:
Unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (URPL) remains a major clinical challenge, and growing evidence suggests that subtle paternal factors—particularly epigenetic and transcriptional abnormalities in sperm—may contribute to its etiology despite normal semen parameters. This study investigated the expression of key spermatogenesis-related and paternally imprinted genes in spermatozoa from men in URPL couples and explored their molecular and bioinformatic signatures.
Methods:
This case–control study included 25 men from couples with idiopathic URPL and 25 age-matched fertile controls recruited between 2023 and 2024. Semen samples were collected and analyzed according to WHO guidelines, and only normozoospermic samples were included. RNA purity, DNA integrity, and exclusion of somatic contamination were confirmed through Nanodrop analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, marker screening, DNase treatment, and no-RT controls. Gene expression (WT1, TET1, ZFAT, CNR2, ZDBF2) was assessed using qPCR. Bioinformatic analyses—including PPI networks, pathway enrichment, WGCNA, and scRNA-seq integration—were performed to characterize gene functions and cellular localization. Machine-learning models (gene ranking and LASSO regression) were used to identify predictive markers.
Results:
Despite normal semen parameters in all subjects, the genes WT1, TET1, ZFAT, and CNR2 showed significant downregulation in the URPL group, whereas ZDBF2 remained unchanged. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed stage-specific expression patterns: WT1 and TET1 were enriched in Sertoli and early germ cells, ZFAT in spermatocytes, and CNR2 and ZDBF2 in spermatids. Bioinformatic analyses identified these genes as central components of pathways involved in epigenetic reprogramming, chromatin remodeling, transcriptional control, GPCR signaling, and germ-cell differentiation. Machine-learning models consistently selected WT1, TET1, ZFAT, and CNR2 as the strongest predictors differentiating URPL from control samples.
Conclusion:
Men from URPL couples exhibit distinct transcriptional and epigenetic-related alterations in sperm despite normal routine semen parameters. The downregulation of WT1, TET1, ZFAT, and CNR2 suggests that subtle molecular defects in sperm may contribute to impaired embryo development and pregnancy maintenance. These genes represent promising biomarker candidates for improved diagnosis and understanding of paternal contributions to URPL.
